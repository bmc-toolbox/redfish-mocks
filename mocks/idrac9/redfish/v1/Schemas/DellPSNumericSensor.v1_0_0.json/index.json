It can also indicate the transitions between these requested states. For example, shutting down (value=4) and starting (value=10) are transient states between enabled and disabled. The following text briefly summarizes the various enabled and disabled states: Enabled (2) indicates that the element is or could be executing commands, will process any queued commands, and queues new requests. Disabled (3) indicates that the element will not execute commands and will drop any new requests. Shutting Down (4) indicates that the element is in the process of going to a Disabled state. Not Applicable (5) indicates the element does not support being enabled or disabled. Enabled but Offline (6) indicates that the element might be completing commands, and will drop any new requests. Test (7) indicates that the element is in a test state. Deferred (8) indicates that the element might be completing commands, but will queue any new requests. Quiesce (9) indicates that the element is enabled but in a restricted mode. Starting (10) indicates that the element is in the process of going to an Enabled state. New requests are queued.",
