A description of the different Sensor types is as follows: A Temperature Sensor measures the environmental temperature. Voltage and Current Sensors measure electrical voltage and current readings. A Tachometer measures speed/revolutions of a Device. For example, a Fan Device can have an associated Tachometer which measures its speed. A Counter is a general purpose Sensor that measures some numerical property of a Device. A Counter value can be cleared, but it never decreases. A Switch Sensor has states like Open/Close, On/Off, or Up/Down. A Lock has states of Locked/Unlocked. Humidity, Smoke Detection and Air Flow Sensors measure the equivalent environmental characteristics. A Presence Sensor detects the presence of a PhysicalElement. A Power Consumption Sensor measures the instantaneous power consumed by a managed element. A Power Production Sensor measures the instantaneous power produced by a managed element such as a power supply or a voltage regulator. A pressure sensor is used to report pressure. Intrusion sensor reports an intrusion of an enclosure regardless whether it was authorized or not.",
